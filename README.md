# EEG_Experimentation

On this file, we can see i can extract a eeg extension and filtering using bandpass filter and ICA-decomposition for EEG-Artifact (EOG and EMG). 
Usually, low and high filter are recomended numbers for filtering are (1 and 55 Hz) or (0.5-60 Hz). (Octaviana, F. (2018). Variasi Normal EEG. In Variasi Normal EEG EEG
Praktis.). Then, as we can see for feature extraction on eeg, some of literatures are recomend for using simple feature for each channels or some channels (mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness) (). But, other contemporary literature suggest on using "new" features (shannon entropy, triple hjprth parameter, and other)
