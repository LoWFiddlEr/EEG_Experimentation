# EEG_Experimentation

On this file, we can see i can extract a eeg extension and filtering using bandpass filter and ICA-decomposition for EEG-Artifact (EOG and EMG). 
Usually, low and high filter are recomended frequency numbers for filtering are (1 - 55 Hz) or (0.5-60 Hz). (Octaviana, F. (2018). Variasi Normal EEG. In Variasi Normal EEG EEG Praktis ; Syeban, Oktaviana, Budikiyanti; 2018 EEG Praktis). Then, as we can see for feature extraction on EEG, some of literatures are recommend for using simple feature for each channels or some channels (mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness) (Azlan, Low. 2014) Feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal - A review). But, other contemporary literature suggest on using "new" features (shannon entropy, triple-hjorth parameter, and other technique) (Phung, et al, 2014( Using Shannon Entropy as EEG Signal Feature for Fast Person Identification).; Hyeon, Lee, Kim, 2014 A Novel EEG Feature Extraction Method Using Hjorth Parameter)). I kindly dont sure are my methods are "right way" for this. Limitation of this code was this code can not process of multiple-directories based of EEG-Files. Especially Matlab files.
