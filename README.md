On this file, we can see i can extract a eeg extension and filtering using bandpass filter and ICA-decomposition for EEG-Artifact (EOG and EMG). 
Usually, low and high filter are recomended numbers for filtering are (1 and 55 Hz) or (0.5-60 Hz). (Octaviana, F. (2018). Variasi Normal EEG. In Variasi Normal EEG EEG
Praktis ; Syeban, Oktaviana, Budikiyanti; 2018 EEG Praktis). Then, as we can see for feature extraction on eeg, some of literatures are recomend for using simple feature for each channels or some channels (mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness) (Azlan, Low. 2014) Feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal - A review). But, other contemporary literature suggest on using "new" features (shannon entropy, triple-hjorth parameter, and other) (Phung, et al, 2014( Using Shannon Entropy as EEG Signal Feature for Fast Person Identification).; Hyeon, Lee, Kim, 2014 A Novel EEG Feature Extraction Method Using Hjorth Parameter)). I Kindly dont sure are my methods are "right way" for this. But, maybe i can gain faith from them
